# Bicycle-Case-Study

## Introduction
Cyclistic is a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600
docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand
tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with
disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of
riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic
users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to
work each day.
Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on
building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that
helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes,
full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day
passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are
Cyclistic members.
Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are
much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic
attract more customers, executives believe that maximizing the number of annual members
will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all new customers, executives believe there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into
members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have
chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.
